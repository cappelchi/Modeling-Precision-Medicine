# Modeling-Precision-Medicine
In this project we discuss biomedical applications of clustering methods and integration of multi-omics data. Specifically, we show that unsupervised machine learning methods can identify distinct subtypes in a set of samples associated with the same pathology. We also touch on questions related to classification and feature selection.
